Jakuzure v.1.0

Given a folder of image files, posts a random image every day to a Facebook group or page. 

This is a small project I started in May of 2019 and left untouched until November 2019. I originally made this to post pictures of Nonon Jakuzure in a Kill la Kill Facebook group. I learned a lot about using the Facebook API from this project.

Please be patient with any mistakes or inefficiencies in this code.
